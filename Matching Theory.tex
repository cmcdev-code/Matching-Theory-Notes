\begin{lemma}{1.0.1}
    For any graph, $G$, $\alpha (G)+\tau(G)=|V(G)|$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be an arbitrary graph and let $M$ be an arbitrary point cover where $|M|=\tau(G)$.
    Then $V(G)-M$ is an independent set of points. This is true because if $V(G)-M$ was not an independent set of points then
    there are at least two points $u,v \in V(G)-M$ where $u$ and $v$ are adjacent. If they are adjacent the line incident with $u$ and $v$ is not covered by $M$ which is a contradiction.
    As $V(G)-M$ is an independent set of points we get the inequality $$\alpha(G) \geq |V(G)-M|= |V(G)|-\tau (G)$$

    Now assume that $L$ is an arbitrary independent set of points where $|L|=\alpha(G)$. Then $V(G)-L$ is a point cover of $G$. If $V(G)-L$ is not a point cover of $G$ then there exists a line $l$ such that $l$ is not covered by $V(G)-L$. However this would imply that $l$ is incident with two points in $L$ this is a contradiction on the fact $L$ is independent points hence $V(G)-L$ is a point cover of $G$. As $V(G)-L$ is a point cover of $G$ we get
    the inequality $$\tau(G) \leq |V(G)-L|=|V(G)|-\alpha(G)$$

    Combining both inequalities we get $\alpha(G) \geq |V(G)|-\tau(G)$ and $\tau(G) \leq |V(G)|-\alpha(G)$. This implies that $$\alpha(G)+\tau(G)=|V(G)|$$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{1.0.2}
    For any graph $G$ with no isolated points, $v(G)+\rho(G)=|V(G)|$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be an arbitrary graph with no isolated points and let $C$ be a line cover of $G$ where $|C|=\rho(G)$. Let $\langle C \rangle$ be the graph formed from lines the set of lines $C$ and the set of points $V(C)$. We have that $\langle C \rangle$ is a union of stars. This is because if $\langle C \rangle$ was not a union of stars. Then there would be two points in the graph that that are adjacent two one or more point in $\langle C \rangle$. If they are adjacent to a single point then removing either of the lines incident would create a smaller minimal line cover. If they are adjacent to two or more points then removing any of the incident lines would create a smaller minimal line cover.
    Now if we let $n$ be the number of components in $\langle C \rangle$ we get that $n=|V(G)|-\rho(G)$ which arises because in each star there is one more point than there are lines. If we take one line from each star we get a matching hence $$v(G)\geq |V(G)| - \rho(G)$$

    Now let $M$ be an arbitrary matching of $G$ where $|M|=v(G)$, and $U$ be the set of points that are not covered by $M$. We get that $U$ is an independent set of points because if $U$ was not an independent set of points then there would be two points $u,v \in U$ such that $u$ and $v$ are adjacent. If $u$ and $v$ are adjacent then there is a line incident with $u$ and $v$ that is not covered by $M$ which is a contradiction. As $U$ is an independent set of points and $G$ has no isolated points we get that $|U| = |V(G)|-2v(G)$. Let $S$ be a line covering of $U$ we get that $M\cup S$ is a line covering. Then we get the inequality $$\rho (G)\leq |M \cup S|= v(G)+|V(G)|-2v(G)=|V(G)|-v(G)$$ Combining both inequalities we get $$v(G)+\rho(G)=|V(G)|$$
\end{proof}


\begin{exercise}{1.0.3}
    \text{\\}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A minimal line cover is minimum if and only if it contains a maximum matching.
        \item A maximal matching is maximum if and only if it is contained in a minimum line cover.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}{(1)}

    Let $L$ be a line cover where $|L|=\rho(G)$. As $L$ is a minimum line cover
    we have that it forms the lines from a union of stars on $G$. We have that the number of stars is $v(G)$ which comes from selecting one matching from each star. Hence $L$ contains a maximum matching.

    Let $L$ be a minimal line cover that contains a maximum matching. Then as $L$ is a union of stars we get a maximum matching by selecting a line from each star. Hence $|L|=|V(G)|-v(G)=\rho(G)$ hence it is a minimum line cover.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}{(2)}
    Let $M$ be a maximum matching. Let $L$ be an line cover obtained by taking an arbitrary line covering of the edges incident with $V(G)-V(M)$ and $M$. We have that $|L|=|V(G)|-2v(G)+v(G)=\rho(G)$ hence $L$ contains a minimum line cover.

    Let $M$ be a maximal matching that is contained in a minimum line cover $L$.
    Then we have that the matchings in $M$ are formed from individual lines of the stars formed by $L$. Hence $|M|=V(G)-\rho(G)=v(G)$ hence $M$ is a maximum matching.
\end{proof}


\begin{exercise}
    {1.0.4}
    For any graph $G$, $v(G)\leq \tau(G)$
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}

    Let $G$ be an arbitrary graph and let $M$ be a maximum matching in $G$. As $M$ is a maximum matching we get that it is contained in a minimum line cover $L$. As $L$ is a minimum line cover we have that it is the union of stars where each matching in $M$ comes from a single line in each star. We get that the number of stars is $\tau(G)$ hence $v(G)\leq \tau(G)$
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
    {1.1.1}
    KÃ¶nig's Minimax Theorem:
    If $G$ is bipartite, then $v(G)=\tau(G)$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Remove lines from $G$ as long as possible while keeping $\tau(G)$ the same. Denote the resulting minimal graph by $G^\prime$. Hence $\tau(G^\prime)=\tau(G)$, but for any line $l\in E(G)$ we have $\tau(G^\prime -l)<\tau(G)$. Suppose that $G^\prime$ does not consist of independent lines. Then there are two lines $l_1, l_2 \in E(G^\prime)$ that are both incident with a point $a \in V(G^\prime)$. As $G^\prime$ is minimal we have that there exists a point cover of $G^\prime-x$ we denote this point cover by $S_x$ where $|S_x|=\tau(G^\prime)-1$. We also have the point cover $S_y$ which is covering $G^\prime -y$ with $|S_x|=|S_y|$.
    Form the induced subgraph $G^{\prime \prime}$ of $G^\prime, \; G^{\prime \prime}=G^\prime[\{a\}\cup S_x\cup S_y \cap \overline{S_x \cap S_y}]$ and let $t=|S_x \cap S_y|$. Then we have $|V(G^{\prime \prime})|=2(\tau(G^\prime)-1 -t)+1$. As $G^{\prime \prime}$ is a subgraph of a bipartite graph we have that it is bipartite. Hence we have a set $T$ which is a point cover of $G^{\prime \prime}$ where $|T|=\tau(G^\prime)-1 -t$.
    We claim that the set of points $T^\prime = T \cup (S_x \cap S_y)$ covers $G^\prime$. Let $z$ be a line in $G^\prime$ if $z\not = x $ or $z\not = y$ then we have that $z$ is covered by $S_x$ and $S_y$ hence it is covered by $S_x \cap S_y$ or it connects $S_x-S_y$ to $S_y-S_x$. If $z=x$ or $z=y$ then we have it is covered by $T$. So $\tau(G^\prime)\leq |T^\prime|= |T\cup (S_x\cap S_y)|=|T|+|S_x\cap S_y|\leq\tau(G^\prime)-1-t+t=\tau(G^\prime)-1$ a contradiction. Hence $G^\prime$ is an independent set of lines. Hence $$\tau(G)=\tau(G^\prime)=v(G^\prime)\leq v(G)$$

\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
    {1.1.2}

    In any (possibly infinite) bipartite graph there exists a matching $M$ and a point cover $P$ such that every line in $M$ contains exactly one point in $P$ and every point in $P$ is contained in exactly one line of $M$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be an arbitrary bipartite graph and let $L$ be a minimum point cover of $G$. From each point in the point cover select one line that is incident with it. Assume that this is not a matching then there are two points that are incident
\end{proof}
